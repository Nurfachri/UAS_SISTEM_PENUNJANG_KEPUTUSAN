The birth of e-commerce in Indonesia stems from the presence of IndoNet. At that time, IndoNet was the Internet Service Provider (ISP) in Indonesia. The emergence of IndoNet became the forerunner to the use of technology in all fields. The online business is no exception.

Then, in 1996, Dyviacom Intrabumi or D-Net appeared which is considered a pioneer of online buying and selling. The presence of this transaction media is of course good news for not only business owners but consumers. By using the internet, the transaction process will be much easier.

However, at first, the use of the internet was only limited to displaying products. For payment transactions, the seller and the consumer still have to meet. The term was later called cash on delivery (COD).

As technology advances, there are also online stores. Then, this is the starting point for the emergence of e-commerce in Indonesia.
